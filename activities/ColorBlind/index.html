    </h1>

    <h3>Introduction</h3>
    <p>
        Color blindness (sometimes refereed to as color-vision deficiency) is the inability to see differences in colors
        and impacts about 8% of males and 0.5% of females (of European descent).
    </p>
    <p>
        This activity demonstrates the importance of selecting the right colors for user interface (UI) elements by utilizing colors that
        are color-blind safe. In this activity, colored circles will be moving across the screen (top to bottom). If a green circle is tapped,
        a successful hit is recorded; otherwise an unsuccessful hit is recorded. In the <i>Alternate Rendering</i> of
        the app, the circles will be rendered in colors as seen by a user with color blindness of type deuteranopia.
        As shown in the below image, a user that is not color blind can easily distinguish the circle colors on the
        screen. However, the same colors will appear to be very similar to a user that is color blind.<br>
