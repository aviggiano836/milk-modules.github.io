    <h3>Introduction</h3>
    <p>
        In this activity, two small buttons are placed close together. A user who is not motion impaired will be able to
        easily tap the desired button. However, a user who has a form of motion impairment, for example, hand tremors, will find it
        difficult to tap the small button. Further, as the buttons are placed close together, the user might tap the wrong
        button. The <i>Alternate Rendering</i> of the app moves the buttons around the screen to simulate a user with hand tremors finding it difficult to tap the buttons.
