    <h3>Introduction</h3>
    <p>
        To support users that have some form of motion impairment in navigating and interacting with apps,
        smartphone and tablet operating systems have the built-in ability to integrate with hardware devices such as
        keyboards and directional pads (D-Pads). At the most basic level, developers can support motion impairment users
        by ensuring that their app is navigable using these external devices. Developers must also ensure that the first
        field in a form is automatically focused (activated) when the user access the screen containing the form.

    </p>
    <p>
        This activity consists of a data entry from that contains text boxes, buttons and a list. By utilizing the
        'nextFocus' properties of the UI elements, users will be able to use the D-Pad to navigate to the different
        elements on the screen instead of touching the elements.<br>
