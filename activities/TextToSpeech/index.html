    <h3>Introduction</h3>
    <p>
        The activity, <i><a href="../SpeechBasedAccessibility_(Simple)/index.html" target="_blank">Speech-based
        accessibility</a></i>, introduced the concept of providing automatic voice based descriptions of user interface
        (UI) elements when touched by a user. Whilst this feature provides blind and limited vision users with a description
        of the UI, it does not provide feedback on the users interaction with the UI elements.
    </p>
    <p>
        This activity incorporates speech to text functionality to provide the user with speech based feedback when the
        user interacts with the UI elements. The activity involves providing the user with the current date and time when the user
        clicks a button. In this activity, the developer will create an event handler for a button, and, within this event handler, call Android's
        SpeechToText API to announce/speak the date and time.
    </p>
